Lets make a poem! Add a line in the poem by your own imagination :3

I'll start -

Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
When the beat drops,
Raindrops, drop tops
We had no reason to cry,
Until our city went dry 
All we can do is try,
To save all from the fry!
yo!! yo!!




ah shit here we go again!
We live for the creed,
So we can create new breed
i dont like to boast
but i love my toast

by amar-belkhede
Shattered soul, tattered mind.
The way back is what I hope to find.
Broken dreams lost without a trace.
Lately I've been feeling a little out of place.

are bhai bhai bhai!!!
with everything having a fry
Until our city went dry,
Dont look too close,Its dark inside
As the liqour stores closed
The bachelors went loosed

it is not a poem
Until our city went dry,
Why your phone beep??,
Put it on SILENT and go to Sleep.
Love U 3000,
Coz Thanos loves Sand. 
i dont know yo,
who the fuck fuck are u
Until our city went dry
you have no clue what to do
until you learn something new
save water save earth
As soon as Wolf began to feel
That he would like a decent meal,
He went and knocked on Grandma's door.
When Grandma opened it, she saw
The sharp white teeth, the horrid grin,
And Wolfie said, 'May I come in?'
Poor Grandmamma was terrified,
'He's going to eat me up!' she cried.
And she was absolutely right.
He ate her up in one big bite.
But Grandmamma was small and tough,
And Wolfie wailed, 'That's not enough!
I haven't yet begun to feel
That I have had a decent meal!'
He ran around the kitchen yelping,
'I've got to have a second helping!

Some people like lemons
Some are sad
Don,t ask why
Its just like that

time pass ho raha hai achha
kisne socha tha mit me vo bhi
jeevan me aur bhi nayi chize milegi
but ye 4 saal hamesha yaad rahenge
Coding is life....and it fucks..lol
